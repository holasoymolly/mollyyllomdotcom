# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev             # Start development server on localhost:3000
npm run build           # Build for production (runs prebuild → image manifest first)
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run image-manifest  # Regen src/lib/image-dimensions.json (needed when new assets are added to public/img/, including .mp4/.webm — those require ffprobe / ffmpeg installed)
```

No test suite is configured.

> ⚠️ **`ffprobe` must be on PATH before running `npm run build`.** The `prebuild` hook regenerates `src/lib/image-dimensions.json`, and without `ffprobe` it **silently drops every `.mp4` / `.webm` / `.mov` entry** instead of failing. The build still succeeds, so it is easy to commit the stripped manifest by accident and lose the CLS-free sizing on every video. After any build, check `git diff src/lib/image-dimensions.json`; if video entries disappeared, `git checkout --` that file and install ffmpeg before rebuilding.

## Branch flow

**Always work on `beta` first, then promote to `main`.** The `beta` branch maps to a beta deployment environment used for preview/validation; `main` is production.

1. Start every change on `beta`. If `beta` is behind `main`, fast-forward it first: `git checkout beta && git merge main --ff-only`.
2. Commit and push to `beta` so the beta deploy picks the changes up.
3. Once the change is validated (build green + beta deploy looks right), promote: `git checkout main && git merge beta --ff-only && git push origin main`. Keep history linear — no merge commits.
4. Return to `beta` so the next iteration starts in the right place.

Non-trivial changes ship as a sequence of small commits (one per logical phase), each pushed to `beta` individually. Commit messages include a `Co-Authored-By` trailer in the project's established style.

## Architecture

**Next.js 15.3.9 App Router** portfolio site for MOLLY YLLOM, a graphic design studio. Deployed on Vercel. Fully bilingual (ES/EN) — site-wide language toggle via `LanguageContext`, CV section has its own `CVLangToggle`.

### Two-layer component pattern
- `src/app/` — Thin Next.js route files. Each `page.tsx` imports and renders from `pageComponents/`.
- `src/pageComponents/` — Full page implementations. Each folder has an `index.ts` barrel export.
- `src/components/` — Shared UI components (`Header`, `Footer`, `AppDrawer`, `PortfolioGrid`, etc.).

### Data files
- `src/projects.tsx` — All portfolio projects as static data. Exports `activeProjects` (ordered array) and `projectsBySlug` (lookup map).
- `src/i18n/translations.ts` — All UI strings for the site-wide ES/EN toggle.
- `src/context/LanguageContext.tsx` — `useLanguage()` hook providing `lang`, `t` (translations), and `toggleLanguage`.
- `src/pageComponents/DownloadsPage/downloadData.ts` — Downloads page data.

### Routes

| Route | Page Component | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| `/` · `/en` | `HomePage` | Grid via `PortfolioGrid`, capped at `HOME_GRID_LIMIT` (15). `Availability` sits directly under the hero |
| `/conoceme` · `/en/conoceme` | `ConocemePage` | |
| `/proyectos` · `/en/proyectos` | `ProjectsPage` | Grid via `PortfolioGrid`, uncapped |
| `/proyectos/[slug]` · `/en/proyectos/[slug]` | `ProjectPage` | Data from `projectsBySlug` |
| `/contacto` · `/en/contacto` | `ContactPage` | |
| `/descargas` · `/en/descargas` | `DownloadsPage` | |
| `/cv` | `NormieCV` | Brand CV, English |
| `/cv/es` | `NormieCV` | Brand CV, Spanish |
| `/cv/web3` | `Web3CV` | Web3 CV, English |
| `/cv/es/web3` | `Web3CV` | Web3 CV, Spanish |

The Mollyverse nav item is an **external** link (`https://www.mollyverse.art/welcome`) rendered as a small icon in Header / AppDrawer / Footer (`public/img/logo/mollyverse-icon.png`), not as text. The site previously had an internal `/nfts` page; it was removed.

### Bilingual routing (`/` = ES, `/en` = EN)

**The URL is the only source of truth for language.** `LanguageProvider` derives `lang` from `usePathname()`; there is no state and no `localStorage`. Metadata is resolved on the server, so a page can only advertise one language, and it must be the one the visitor actually sees. This also means a shared link keeps its language, which a stored preference could never do.

**The two languages address two different readers, but the copy is kept in lockstep.** Spanish is read by Dominican clients who buy design projects; English is read by US recruiters arriving from her CV. In September 2026 both sides moved off "graphic design studio / cotiza tu proyecto" and onto the art director and brand designer positioning, with an availability block under the hero, because the studio framing read as "runs her own business, not open to being hired". Any copy change to one language now ships with its counterpart in the same commit: `Translations` is `typeof translations.es`, so a key added to only one branch fails `tsc`.

The helpers all live in `src/i18n/routes.ts` and every route change goes through them:

| Helper | Use |
|---|---|
| `langFromPathname(path)` | `'en'` if the path is `/en` or under it, else `'es'` |
| `stripLocale(path)` | Drop the `/en` prefix. Used for active-nav comparison in `Header` / `AppDrawer`, whose `navLinks` hold unprefixed hrefs |
| `withLocale(href, lang)` | **Only ever adds.** `TransitionLink` calls it so every internal link inherits the language of the page it sits on |
| `localizePath(path, lang)` | Adds *or* strips. Only the language toggle needs this, so toggling holds the reader on the same page |

Consequences to keep in mind:

- **Adding a page means adding both routes.** A new `src/app/foo/page.tsx` needs an `src/app/en/foo/page.tsx` beside it, plus its root in `LOCALIZED_ROOTS` in `routes.ts`, or the `/en` nav will link to a 404.
- `/cv/**` is deliberately **not** in `LOCALIZED_ROOTS`. The CVs carry their language in the URL already (`/cv` vs `/cv/es`) and have their own toggle, so prefixing them would point at routes that do not exist. Their back links name the target explicitly (`lang === "es" ? "/" : "/en"`), which `withLocale` leaves alone precisely because it never strips.
- Route segments stay Spanish under `/en` (`/en/proyectos`, not `/en/projects`). The prefix is then a pure string operation, which is what keeps the helpers this small.

### SEO metadata

Per-route metadata lives on the **server-component `page.tsx`** wrappers in `src/app/...` — not on the client `pageComponents/...` implementations:

- Static routes export a `metadata: Metadata` constant, in both languages (`/conoceme` and `/en/conoceme`, and so on).
- Both `/proyectos/[slug]` and `/en/proyectos/[slug]` use `generateMetadata` to derive title + OG image from the project's `heroImage` and first paragraph (`paragraphs[0]` / `paragraphsEn[0]`), and `generateStaticParams` so each project pre-renders as static HTML at build time in both languages.
- **Every route declares `alternates`**: its own `canonical` plus a `languages` map built by `languageAlternates()` in `src/i18n/metadata.ts`. Google only honours an alternate when both URLs point at each other, so the pair share an identical map and differ only in which one they call canonical. The four CV pages build theirs by hand, since they pair with each other rather than with an `/en` twin.
- A route with **no** `alternates` inherits `canonical: "/"` from the root layout and reads to Google as a duplicate of the home page. Never leave a new route without one.
- `metaDescription()` in `src/i18n/metadata.ts` trims a paragraph to a search snippet on a sentence or word boundary. Use it instead of `slice(0, 160)`, which left descriptions ending mid-phrase.
- Descriptions and OG copy are written per language, not machine-translated from the other side.
- Root-level metadata + OG image live in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` and `src/app/robots.ts` produce `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` automatically — `sitemap.ts` emits both languages of every static route and every entry in `activeProjects`, each carrying `alternates.languages`, plus the four CV routes.

### Where the CTAs point

The site serves two readers at once: US recruiters hiring a person, and Dominican clients commissioning a project. Both paths converge on `/contacto`, and neither may lose its door.

| CTA | Goes to |
|---|---|
| Hero button (`home.cta`), closing banner (`quoteBanner.cta`), mobile drawer button | `/contacto` |
| Availability block, "Get in touch" (`home.availabilityContactCta`) | `/contacto` |
| Availability block, "Download resume" | `public/downloads/brand/…` |
| Contact page, "Book a call" | Calendly |
| Contact page, "Request a quote" (`contact.quoteUrl`) | The Google quote form |

Until September 2026 the hero and closing CTAs went straight to the Google quote form. Once their labels became "Get in touch" / "Hablemos", that destination contradicted them: a recruiter clicking a neutral CTA landed on a form asking for a project budget. They now point at `/contacto`, which is why **the contact page carries the quote block: it is the quote form's only entry point on the whole site.** Never remove it, and never point a general CTA back at the form directly.

`contact.quoteUrl` is a different form per language and lives in `contact` rather than `quoteBanner` for exactly this reason. There is no second copy of either URL.

### Navigation & page transitions
The site uses the native **View Transitions API** for all internal navigation, enabled via `experimental: { viewTransition: true }` in `next.config.ts`. The crossfade keyframes (`cv-fade-out` / `cv-fade-in`, 350ms ease-in-out) live in `src/app/globals.css` and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Always use `<TransitionLink>` from `@/components/TransitionLink` for internal links** — never plain `<a>` or `next/link` `<Link>`. `TransitionLink` wraps `next/link` and intercepts the click to call `React.startTransition(() => router.push(href))`, which Next.js hooks into the View Transitions API. It correctly delegates modifier-key clicks (cmd/ctrl/shift), `target="_blank"`, and `mailto:` / `tel:` / `http(s)://` URLs to the browser.

`TransitionLink` also **localizes every internal href** through `withLocale()`, so components write plain Spanish paths (`/proyectos`) and get `/en/proyectos` automatically when the reader is in English. Write the unprefixed path; never hand-write `/en/...` unless you specifically mean to pin a link to English regardless of context, the way the CV back links do.

For programmatic navigation from buttons (e.g. the CV toggles in `CVVersionToggle` / `CVLangToggle`), call `React.startTransition(() => router.push(href))` directly — same effect.

External links (Calendly, social) stay as plain `<a target="_blank">`.

### Analytics

**RULE — analytics only ever run in production.** Every third-party tracker is keyed off an env var that exists on the Vercel **Production** environment *only*, never on Preview, Development, or local `.env.local`. The absence of the id is the switch, so dev and beta traffic can't pollute the live data. When adding any new tracker, follow the same pattern: read its id from a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env var, render/init nothing when it's missing, and set the var on Production only.

| Tracker | Env var | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| Google Analytics | `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` (`G-Q3TSX67D2J`) | `{gaId && <GoogleAnalytics gaId={gaId} />}` in `src/app/layout.tsx` |
| Amplitude | `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` | `initAll` skipped in `src/amplitude.ts`; `track()` no-ops via `isAmplitudeEnabled` |
| Apollo website visitor tracker | `NEXT_PUBLIC_APOLLO_APP_ID` | `{apolloAppId && <Script … />}` in `src/app/layout.tsx` |

**Apollo** identifies which *companies* visit the site (B2B visitor de-anonymization), feeding outreach — it is not event analytics. The snippet is embedded with `<Script>` from `next/script` (the standard Next.js mechanism for third-party scripts) using `strategy="beforeInteractive"`, because Apollo requires it to load in the head as early as possible on every page; `next/script` dedupes by `id` so it runs exactly once per page load. Get the snippet from Apollo's MCP `apollo_website_visitor_domain_tracker_install_script` tool rather than hand-assembling it. Note that the script alone does nothing until the domain is registered in Apollo's tracker settings.

Google Analytics uses `<GoogleAnalytics>` from `@next/third-parties/google` — the official Next.js integration. The GA property has a single web stream (`mollyyllom.com`, stream id 8220526592) with Enhanced Measurement on, so page views, scrolls and outbound clicks are captured without extra code.

Vercel Analytics (`<Analytics />`) and Vercel Speed Insights (`<SpeedInsights />`) are **not** gated — they are Vercel-native, report into Vercel's own dashboard rather than GA/Amplitude, and distinguish production from preview there.

**Amplitude** (Analytics + Session Replay) follows [Amplitude's official Next.js installation guide](https://amplitude.com/docs/sdks/frameworks/nextjs-installation-guide) — do not hand-roll an alternative setup:
- `src/amplitude.ts` is the single initialization module (`'use client'`, `@amplitude/unified`, `initAll` guarded by `typeof window !== 'undefined'` so it only ever runs client-side and only once). It exports a no-op `<Amplitude />` component and the `amplitude` instance as default.
- `<Amplitude />` is rendered in the root layout; the API key comes from `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY`.
- **Production only**, per the rule above. `src/amplitude.ts` skips `initAll` when the key is missing, and `track()` in `src/lib/analytics.ts` becomes a no-op via the exported `isAmplitudeEnabled` flag (so calls don't pile up in the SDK's pre-init queue). Never add the key to another environment to "test in preview" — verify locally instead, per the debugging recipe below.
- `autocapture: true` covers page views, clicks, form interactions and file downloads, so most tracking needs no code.
- Session Replay runs at `sampleRate: 1`.

#### Named conversion events

Autocapture records every click as a generic `[Amplitude] Element Clicked` identified by CSS selector — which breaks the moment the markup changes. High-intent actions therefore get a **named** event, defined as a typed helper in `src/lib/analytics.ts` and called from the component's `onClick` (or a mount `useEffect` for views).

| Event | Fires when | Properties | Call sites |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| `Booking CTA Clicked` | Any Calendly button is clicked — the strongest buying signal on the site | `location`, `lang` | `HomePage/components/MediaSection`, `ConocemePage`, `ContactPage` |
| `Email CTA Clicked` | The `hola@mollyyllom.com` mailto link is clicked | `location`, `lang` | `ContactPage` |
| `Quote CTA Clicked` | The project quote form is opened, the design-client counterpart to a booking | `location`, `lang` | `ContactPage` |
| `Newsletter CTA Clicked` | The newsletter signup link in the footer is clicked | `location`, `lang` | `Footer` |
| `Asset Downloaded` | A downloadable asset is opened, on `/descargas` or from the home availability block | `assetTitle`, `assetUrl`, `lang` | `DownloadsPage`, `HomePage/components/Availability` |
| `Project Viewed` | A case study page mounts (once per slug; the language toggle does not re-fire it) | `projectSlug`, `projectTitle`, `lang` | `ProjectPage` |

**RULE — whenever you add, remove, or change a user-facing conversion point, update Amplitude tracking and this table in the same commit.** Concretely:
- A new CTA, download, contact route, external booking link, or funnel step gets a named event via a new helper in `src/lib/analytics.ts` — never a bare `amplitude.track('...')` string literal inline in a component.
- Every event carries `lang` so ES/EN performance stays comparable, and a `location` (or entity id such as `projectSlug`) so the same event fired from different surfaces can be told apart.
- **Event names are permanent.** Renaming one in code splits its history into two series in Amplitude and silently breaks any saved chart or funnel. If a name is genuinely wrong, rename it in the Amplitude UI, not in code.
- Removing a tracked CTA means removing its row from this table too, so the catalogue never drifts from the code.
- Use Title Case for event names and camelCase for property names, matching the table above.

To verify events locally: uncomment `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` in `.env.local` (tracking is off locally by default), temporarily add `logLevel: amplitude.Types.LogLevel.Debug` to the `analytics` config in `src/amplitude.ts`, restart `npm run dev`, trigger the interaction, and look for `"name": "track"` in the browser console — it logs the event name, properties, and the exact call site. Re-comment the key and revert the `logLevel` line when done; note that events fired this way do land in the live Amplitude project.

## Design System

### Color palette
| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `bg-indigo-950` | #1e1b4b | Dark backgrounds, hero sections, alternating dark sections |
| `bg-stone-200` | #e7e5e4 | Light backgrounds, alternating light sections |
| `bg-white` | #ffffff | Cards inside light sections |
| `text-violet-400` | accent | Dark section headings, kickers, accents |
| `text-violet-500` | accent | Light section headings, kickers, accents |
| `bg-violet-500` | primary CTA | Buttons, active toggle states |
| `hover:bg-violet-400` | hover | Button hover state |
| `text-slate-300/400` | body text on dark | Paragraphs and secondary text on dark backgrounds |
| `text-indigo-950/70` | body text on light | Paragraphs on light backgrounds |

### Typography
- **H1 (hero):** `text-6xl sm:text-7xl md:text-8xl font-black leading-[0.9] tracking-tight`
- **H2 (section):** `text-4xl sm:text-5xl font-black leading-tight` — always two lines, second line in violet accent
- **Kicker (above h2):** `text-xs font-bold tracking-[0.3em] uppercase` in violet
- **Body:** `text-lg leading-relaxed`
- **Tags/pills:** `text-xs px-3 py-1 rounded-full`
- Font family: Arial / Helvetica (system sans-serif)

### Section pattern
Every section follows: **violet kicker → big two-line h2 → content**. The h2 always has a plain first line and a colored second line:
```jsx
<p className="text-violet-400 text-xs font-bold tracking-[0.3em] uppercase mb-4">Kicker</p>
<h2 className="text-4xl sm:text-5xl font-black leading-tight mb-16">
  First line<br />
  <span className="text-violet-400">Second line</span>
</h2>
```

### Layout
- **Horizontal padding:** `px-6 md:px-16 lg:px-24` (used consistently everywhere)
- **Section vertical padding:** `py-20`
- **Max width (content):** `max-w-4xl mx-auto` for text-heavy sections, `max-w-6xl mx-auto` for grids
- **Alternating sections:** Dark (`bg-indigo-950`) → Light (`bg-stone-200`) → Dark → Light...
- **Cards on light:** `bg-white rounded-2xl border border-stone-200 p-6 md:p-8`
- **Cards on dark:** `border border-stone-200/10 rounded-2xl p-6 md:p-8` with hover `hover:border-violet-500/40`

### Animations (Framer Motion)
Two helpers used throughout:
```ts
// Hero entrance (uses animate, not whileInView)
const fadeUp = (delay = 0) => ({
  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
  transition: { duration: 0.6, delay, ease: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1] },
})

// Scroll-triggered sections
const fadeUpView = (delay = 0) => ({
  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  whileInView: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
  viewport: { once: true },
  transition: { duration: 0.6, delay, ease: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1] },
})
```
Hero elements stagger: 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.35. Section items stagger: `i * 0.04` to `i * 0.1`.

### Buttons
- **Primary CTA:** `bg-violet-500 text-stone-200 font-bold px-8 py-4 rounded-full hover:bg-violet-400`
- **Secondary (on dark):** `border border-stone-200/20 text-slate-300 font-semibold px-8 py-4 rounded-full hover:border-violet-400 hover:text-violet-400`
- **Secondary (on light):** `border border-indigo-950/20 text-indigo-950/70 font-semibold px-8 py-4 rounded-full hover:border-violet-500 hover:text-violet-500`

### Image / video protection (ALWAYS apply this)

**Never use plain `<img>`, `<video>`, or Next.js `<Image>` directly for content media.** All visible content images and short looping videos go through `<ProtectedImage>` from `@/components/ProtectedImage`, which wraps `next/image` (or `<video>` for video sources) and blocks drag-and-drop, right-click, and drag-ghost preview.

`ProtectedImage` auto-selects between `fill` and intrinsic mode:

1. If you pass `fill` explicitly → fill mode (parent must be sized; ProtectedImage adds its own `position: relative` wrapper).
2. If you pass explicit `width` + `height` → intrinsic mode.
3. If neither, the `src` is looked up in the build-time manifest at `src/lib/image-dimensions.json` (generated by `npm run image-manifest` and via the `prebuild` hook) → intrinsic mode using those dims.
4. Otherwise → fill mode.

GIFs are auto-passed `unoptimized` so animation is preserved.

**Video sources (.mp4 / .webm / .mov)** — when `src` matches one of these extensions, ProtectedImage renders a `<video autoplay loop muted playsInline>` instead of `<Image>`, inside the same protected wrapper. The `priority` prop switches the video's `preload` from `"metadata"` → `"auto"` so above-the-fold videos start loading immediately. Image-only props (`quality`, `sizes`, `unoptimized`) are silently dropped for the video branch — they don't apply. Video dimensions are populated by `ffprobe` in the manifest script, so the same intrinsic vs fill logic and CLS-free sizing applies to videos.

**When to convert a GIF to MP4:** any animated thumbnail or in-body GIF over ~500 KB should be converted (`ffmpeg -i in.gif -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset slower -an out.mp4`; bump `-crf` to 28 with `-preset veryslow` if the result isn't meaningfully smaller). The GIF is deleted, `projects.tsx` is repointed at the `.mp4`, and the manifest is regenerated. Smaller GIFs stay as GIFs.

**Incoming MP4s get re-encoded too.** Source videos handed over for a project are usually export-quality (multiple MB at 3+ Mbps) and go straight into a grid thumbnail, so they get the same treatment: `-movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -an`, no audio track since playback is always muted.

Pick `-crf` by **content**, not by file size, and verify before replacing the original:

- **Flat vector art / motion graphics** → `-crf 23` or higher. Large areas of solid color compress hard with no visible loss.
- **Screen recordings of a UI** → `-crf 20`. Small text is the first thing to go, and it turns to mush well before the artifacts are obvious in a moving preview. Burn & Claim's `16.mp4` went 3.4 MB → 616 KB at crf 20 with no visible loss; the same clip at crf 28 was 356 KB but blurred the body copy in the UI cards.

To verify, extract the same frame from both and compare a 1:1 crop of the smallest text, not the scaled-down whole frame: `ffmpeg -ss 4 -i in.mp4 -frames:v 1 -vf "crop=900:200:300:620" out.png`. Scrubbing the video or eyeballing the full frame will not reveal the degradation. Back the original up outside the repo before overwriting.

### Optimizing a delivered asset folder (ALWAYS do this on intake)

Handed-over folders arrive at export quality. Ciudad Fiel shipped at 27 MB, Aerosol at 5.9 MB and Burn & Claim at 8.1 MB; all three came down to under 3 MB with no visible loss. Do this **before** the first commit of a project, not as a later cleanup.

**Static images** → downscale to a **3840px long edge** and re-encode **webp at quality 82**. Sources arrive at 7000-11500px, which is pure waste: `deviceSizes` in `next.config.ts` tops out at 5120, and 3840 is already past what any real viewport requests. Use `sharp` (already in `node_modules` as a Next.js dependency, so no install) with `{ quality: 82, effort: 6, smartSubsample: true }`. Keep the re-encode only when it actually wins; flat vector art occasionally comes out *larger*, so compare against the original and skip those. Verify on the highest-entropy asset in the folder, typically a photographic mockup with fine grain, by comparing a 1:1 crop against the source. Quality 82 was indistinguishable on a leather-emboss photo.

**Animated assets** → h264, same crf rules as above.

Two traps, both of which silently destroy work:

- **Some delivered `.webp` files are animated, and nothing warns you.** Seven of them were in Aerosol and Burn & Claim. `sharp` flattens them to frame 1 unless opened with `{ animated: true }`, so a batch re-encode will quietly turn a 90-frame loop into a still. Always check `metadata().pages > 1` first and branch. Note this is not only a size problem: Next.js detects animated sources and serves them **unoptimized**, so the raw file goes over the wire at full weight, up to 4.8 MB for one in-body frame. Converting them to MP4 is the fix, and it is worth doing well below the ~500 KB GIF threshold.
- **`ffmpeg` cannot decode animated webp at all** (`ffprobe` reports "image data not found", which reads like a corrupt file). Extract the frames with `sharp` first, which decodes an animated webp into one tall strip of `pages` frames to slice with `.extract()`, write them as numbered PNGs, then feed `ffmpeg` an image sequence at `1000 / avg(metadata().delay)` fps.

After converting, delete the source file, repoint `projects.tsx`, regenerate the manifest, and confirm the first frame of each new MP4 has real content, since it doubles as the poster.

**Videos never play in the Claude-in-Chrome tab.** `readyState` stays 0 with no error, on localhost *and* on the live production site, for files known to work in real browsers. Do not debug this; confirm the encode with `ffmpeg` instead and ask Molly to eyeball the beta deploy.

**Quality convention:** `quality={90}` is opted into per call site for every visible content image (hero/body images on `/proyectos/[slug]`, both Molly portraits, PortfolioGrid thumbs, Downloads thumbs, both CV profile photos). Decorative/UI images use the default 75. `next.config.ts` allows both via `qualities: [75, 90]`; only those two values are valid.

```tsx
// Fill mode — parent is sized, image fills it
<figure className="w-full md:w-1/2 h-56 md:h-auto overflow-hidden">
  <ProtectedImage
    src="/img/molly/molly1.webp"
    alt="Molly Yllom"
    fill
    sizes="(min-width: 768px) 50vw, 100vw"
    className="object-cover"
  />
</figure>

// Intrinsic via manifest — works for any image in /public/img/
// (no width/height props needed; dims resolved at build time)
<div className="w-full overflow-hidden">
  <ProtectedImage
    src={image}
    alt={...}
    sizes="100vw"
    className="w-full h-auto"
  />
</div>

// Round avatar — fill mode with wrapperClassName carrying size/shape/border
<ProtectedImage
  wrapperClassName="w-64 h-64 rounded-full overflow-hidden border-2 border-violet-500/50"
  src="/img/photo.jpg"
  alt="..."
  fill
  sizes="256px"
  className="object-cover"
  priority
/>
```

Always pass a `sizes` prop on fill-mode images so next/image can pick the right srcset variant. For intrinsic-mode images that span the viewport, pass `sizes="100vw"`.

`priority` should be set only on the LCP image of a page (typically the hero).

The image-dimensions manifest is regenerated automatically before every build (via the `prebuild` npm script) and can be run manually with `npm run image-manifest` whenever you add new assets to `public/img/`.

Logo images in the `<Header>` and `<Footer>` are exempt from protection (they are decorative/brand assets served publicly anyway) — they use `next/image` directly with explicit `width`/`height`.

    text-slate-400 hover:text-stone-200 cursor-pointer">Inactive</button>
</div>
```
Toggles use `<button>` (not `<Link>`) with `React.startTransition(() => router.push(href))` for View Transitions integration. Use `variant="light"` prop on `CVVersionToggle` / `CVLangToggle` when placed on a `bg-stone-200` background — switches border and inactive text to dark-on-light variants.

### CV design decisions
- **No site Header/Footer** on CV pages — CVs are standalone documents. A discreet `← mollyyllom.com` link sits inside the hero section (top-left), aligned with content padding.
- **Brand CV** (`/cv`, `/cv/es`): alternating dark/light sections matching the main site pattern.
- **Web3 CV** (`/cv/web3`, `/cv/es/web3`): fully dark (`bg-indigo-950` throughout), violet accents, darker atmosphere.
- **Page transition:** Uses the same site-wide View Transitions setup (see "Navigation & page transitions" above). The CV's `← mollyyllom.com` back link uses `<TransitionLink>`; `CVVersionToggle` / `CVLangToggle` use `<button>` + `React.startTransition(() => router.push(href))` because they need the active-state styling on a button.
- **Language toggle** (`CVLangToggle`) and **version toggle** (`CVVersionToggle`) are cross-aware: switching language keeps the current mode, switching mode keeps the current language.
- **Skills stay in English** in both language versions — standard for design/tech CVs.
- **Profile photos:** `molly_pfp.jpg` (brand), `molly_pfp_web3.jpg` (web3) — both in `public/img/molly/`. Size: `w-64 h-64 md:w-80 md:h-80`, circular with violet glow shadow.
- **Social links** (LinkedIn, X) — icon-only, no text labels.
- **Downloadable PDFs:** `CVResumeDownload` sits beside the toggles on all four CV pages and follows the active version, serving `public/downloads/brand/` on `/cv` and `/cv/es` and `public/downloads/web3/` on the web3 pair.

#### The résumé PDFs

Two files, both named **exactly** `Cinthya-Paulino-Resume.pdf`:

| Path | Served from |
|---|---|
| `public/downloads/brand/Cinthya-Paulino-Resume.pdf` | `/cv`, `/cv/es`, the home availability block, `/descargas` |
| `public/downloads/web3/Cinthya-Paulino-Resume.pdf` | `/cv/web3`, `/cv/es/web3` |

The variant lives in the **folder name, never in the filename**, on purpose: the filename is what a recruiter sees in their downloads folder, and it must not advertise that other versions exist. Never rename either file, and never add a suffix, a date, a version, or the word ATS. Both URLs are exported from `src/lib/resume.ts`; nothing hard-codes the path.

Both PDFs are in English. There is no Spanish translation yet, so `/cv/es` deliberately serves the English file.

`.gitignore` has a blanket `*.pdf`, with a `!public/downloads/**/*.pdf` exception directly under it. Without that exception the PDFs are never committed and every download 404s on the deploy, while working perfectly in local dev.

### BRAND is not a reordering of WEB3

The BRAND CV (`/cv`, `/cv/es`) and the WEB3 CV (`/cv/web3`, `/cv/es/web3`) describe the same work in different vocabulary. That divergence is the point of the toggle: if both pages name Solana six times, the toggle does nothing.

**The downloadable PDF is the source of truth for BRAND's wording.** The two are one click apart now that `CVResumeDownload` sits on the page, so a recruiter can hold them side by side. Where they disagree, the page is wrong. The PDF says "a digital products company", "a transactional web application", "a consumer web platform", "Mollyverse, Independent Product Venture"; BRAND was audited to match in September 2026.

Nothing is hidden: WEB3 still carries the full crypto record, which is its job. When editing, keep the two data sets apart, and note which files are shared:

| File | Feeds |
|---|---|
| `web2/experience.tsx`, `.es.tsx` | BRAND only |
| `web3/experience.tsx`, `.es.tsx` | WEB3 only |
| `common/skills.ts` | **BRAND only**, despite the folder name. WEB3 has its own copy in `web3/skills.ts` |
| `common/education.ts`, `.es.ts` | Both |

A change meant for one variant that lands in `common/` will silently reach the other. Check before editing.

### CV i18n pattern
Each page component receives `lang: 'en' | 'es'` prop. A `copy` object inside the component holds all UI strings for both languages. Resume data is separate: `web2Resume` / `web2ResumeES`, `web3Resume` / `web3ResumeES`.

### CV content rules (from audits)
- `featureHighlight` must be different from the first bullet point — no duplication.
- Every section h2 uses the two-line violet accent pattern (no exceptions).
- Kicker labels and badge text ("Current"/"Actual") must match the page language.
- Hero photo uses `md:items-start` (not `md:items-center`) to avoid floating when text is taller than photo.
- **The CV here is the same résumé as Molly's LinkedIn, Indeed, and the downloadable PDFs, so keep all of them consistent.** LinkedIn is the source of truth for titles, dates, and the years-of-experience figure. If you change a role, a date, or that number here, update the other surfaces too, and vice versa. Do not add project names, client counts, awards, or launch specifics that go stale, keep it general and verifiable.
- **Aerosol is two roles (a promotion) inside one tenure.** Molly has partnered with Aerosol since early 2024 and became Head of Design in Jan 2026. Both facts have to survive, and neither shape below is optional:
  - Never collapse them into "Head of Design since 2024". That overstates how long she has held the title.
  - Never split them into two sibling `Experience` entries either. Read in 2026, a standalone "Head of Design, 2026 - Present" card says eight months of leadership and buries the two years before it.
  - The shape that holds both is one `Experience` for Aerosol, `2024 - Present`, with the two titles as `stages` (see `ExperienceStage` in `src/cv/types.ts`). The card header carries the company and the full range, each stage carries its own title, dates and bullets, and the card-level `highlights` array stays empty. Both CV components render `stages`; the Web3 CV renders `experience[0]` only, so on that page the stages are the *only* way the 2024 to 2026 work appears at all.
  - This mirrors the PDF résumé, which merged the two stages in August 2026. Mollyverse is a separate current role (Designer & Front-end Developer, 2026 to Present).
- **Do not describe the Aerosol design system as "tiered" or "por niveles".** No such tiered system exists; the claim was audited out of both the CV and `/proyectos/aerosol` in September 2026. The approved wording is a brand system with sub-brand architecture and an organized asset library, so product, marketing and partner teams find what they need without design becoming a bottleneck.
- **Molly is not an illustrator.** Her words: "no soy ilustradora, soy entusiasta de la ilustración." Illustration can appear inside a project's `scope`, but never as a headline label that positions her as one, which is why Dito Dico keeps the default grid label instead of "Ilustración de personaje".
- **The years-of-experience figure is "17+", and it is scattered across the CV *and the main site*.** It has drifted twice: once between a CV page and its own meta description, and once between the CV section (updated to 17+) and the whole rest of the site (left at 20+ for a full release, because that change only touched `src/cv/**` and `src/app/cv/**`). When the number, the headline role, or the summary changes, update every row below in the same commit and then `grep -rni "20+\|17+\|20 años\|17 años\|20 years\|17 years\|diecisiete\|seventeen\|veinte\|twenty" src/` to confirm nothing is left behind. The spelled-out forms matter: the home hero and both home meta descriptions write the number as a word:

  | Where | What |
  |---|---|
  | `src/cv/pageComponents/{normie/NormieCV,web3/Web3CV}.tsx` | the `copy` object: `heroBio` and `experienceH2b`, EN and ES |
  | `src/app/cv/page.tsx`, `cv/es`, `cv/web3`, `cv/es/web3` | `metadata.description` on all four |
  | `src/i18n/translations.ts` | `about.bio` *and* `home.subheadline`, EN and ES. The subheadline spells the figure out ("Seventeen years" / "Diecisiete años"), so the numeric grep below will not catch it |
  | `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/en/page.tsx` | `metadata.description` *and* `openGraph.description` on both homes, also spelled out |
  | `src/pageComponents/HomePage/components/MediaSection.tsx` | the `stats` array — the `stat1` value tile |
  | `src/app/conoceme/page.tsx` | `metadata.description` *and* `openGraph.description` |
  | `src/app/en/conoceme/page.tsx` | the same two, in English. Easy to miss: it is a separate file from the Spanish one |

  Two matches are **not** this figure and must stay at 20: the INDHAUCI paragraphs in `src/projects.tsx` say her parents founded the company more than 20 years ago. `contact.summary` in `cv/data/resumeData/web{2,3}/contact.tsx` derives the number from `calculateYearsOfExperience` (currently 18, since the earliest `start` is 2008) but is not rendered anywhere, so it does not need to agree. LinkedIn, not the arithmetic, is the source of truth for the visible figure.

### Adding/editing CV content
- Job experience (Brand CV): `src/cv/data/resumeData/web2/experience.tsx` (EN) and `experience.es.tsx` (ES)
- Job experience (Web3 CV): `src/cv/data/resumeData/web3/experience.tsx` (EN) and `experience.es.tsx` (ES)
- Selected projects: `contractWork.tsx` / `contractWork.es.tsx`
- Skills: `src/cv/data/resumeData/common/skills.ts` (shared EN), `web3/skills.ts` (web3 reordered)
- Education: `common/education.ts` (EN), `common/education.es.ts` (ES)
- Social/contact: `web2/contact.tsx` and `web3/contact.tsx`
- URLs used in links (Aerosol, Burn & Claim, Mollyverse, etc.): `src/cv/data/constants.ts`
- Hero bio, kicker, section headings, and the years figure: the `copy` object at the top of `pageComponents/normie/NormieCV.tsx` and `pageComponents/web3/Web3CV.tsx`. The Web3 hero bio also names the current Aerosol title, keep it in step with the experience data.
- Page title and SEO description: the `metadata` export in `app/cv/page.tsx`, `app/cv/es/page.tsx`, `app/cv/web3/page.tsx`, and `app/cv/es/web3/page.tsx`. These duplicate the headline role and years figure, so they must be updated alongside the component copy.

## Adding a New Project

1. Place images (and any animated MP4 thumbnails) in `public/img/projects/[slug]/`. **Folder names are kebab-case ASCII only.** No `&`, spaces, or accents: those characters survive the filesystem but break in URL paths and in the `next/image` query string, and they make the manifest keys awkward to grep. `Burn & Claim` lives in `public/img/projects/burn-claim/`.
2. **Optimize the folder before anything else** — see "Optimizing a delivered asset folder" above. Assets arrive at export quality and routinely shrink by 90%. Doing it now avoids committing the heavy versions into git history, where they stay forever.
3. Define a `Project` object in `src/projects.tsx` with `slug`, `title`, `portfolioImage`, `heroImage`, `paragraphs`, `paragraphsEn`, `images`.
   - `portfolioImage` is shown in the PortfolioGrid (square thumb, fill mode, animated MP4 or static image both work).
   - `heroImage` is shown full-bleed at `h-[50vh] md:h-[70vh]` with `object-cover` — pick a high-resolution mockup (≥3840px wide ideal, ≥2400px minimum). Thin "logo usage sheet" images (~625px tall) will pixelate as heroes; use a real product mockup instead.
   - `heroImage` should not also appear in `images[]` (would render the same asset twice on the page).
   - **Mind the hero crop.** The hero is cropped to roughly 1.6:1 by `object-cover`, so a very wide image (3:1 key art) loses about half its width and a square one loses its top and bottom. Anything with text near the edges gets guillotined. A near-full-bleed image with a single centered subject crops gracefully at any viewport; prefer that over the "best" image when the best one has typography in it.
4. Add it to the **top** of `activeProjects` — see ordering below.
5. The `prebuild` hook will pick up the new media on the next `npm run build`. To get the image-dimensions manifest updated immediately (e.g. for `npm run dev`), run `npm run image-manifest`.

`/proyectos/[slug]` uses `generateStaticParams`, so the new project will get its own pre-rendered HTML page automatically. Sitemap entries are also generated automatically from `activeProjects`.

### Ordering and the 15-project home grid

`activeProjects` is ordered **newest first**. New work goes at index 0, and that single edit drives every surface: both grids, the `NN / NN` counter, the prev/next footer links, and the sitemap.

The two grids differ only in length, and both render from the same `<PortfolioGrid>`:

| Surface | Renders | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `/` (home) | `<PortfolioGrid limit={HOME_GRID_LIMIT} />` | Always exactly 15 tiles. A new project enters at the top and the oldest one drops off the bottom. |
| `/proyectos` | `<PortfolioGrid showHeader={false} />` | No limit. Grows forever, nothing is ever displaced. |

Each tile's kicker comes from the project's optional `gridLabel` / `gridLabelEn`, falling back to `portfolio.brandingLabel` ("Branding · Identidad"). Those labels are **derived from that project's own `scope` / `scopeEn`**, taking the two most representative entries written exactly as they appear there. Never invent a label, and leave the field out when the scope really is only branding. Two projects deliberately keep the default despite a broader scope: Dito Dico, because an illustration label positions Molly as an illustrator, and Dinerology, because it won a Bronze Effie (Dominican Republic, 2023) and a "YouTube assets" label sells it as loose social pieces.

`HOME_GRID_LIMIT` is exported from `src/projects.tsx`. A project that scrolls off the home grid is **not** removed: it keeps its `/proyectos` tile, its case study page, and its sitemap entry. Nothing needs deleting when the list grows, so never trim `activeProjects` to keep the home page at 15.
